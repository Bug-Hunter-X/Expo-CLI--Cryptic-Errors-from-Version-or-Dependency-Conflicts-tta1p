The solution focuses on addressing potential dependency and version conflicts within your project's `package.json`. First, ensure your project is using the latest version of Expo by running: `npx expo install expo` This will install or update the expo package to the correct version for your project. Carefully review your `package.json` to check for any version mismatches between `expo` and other Expo-related packages. Ensure all packages are using compatible versions. If you have any discrepancies, manually adjust the versions in `package.json` accordingly to ensure consistency. After making changes to `package.json`, run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install or reinstall the updated packages. If the problem persists, use `expo prebuild --clean` to clear the build cache.  Sometimes a stale cache can cause similar errors. Lastly, always use `expo upgrade` to update to the latest version, and check your Expo CLI version.  Make sure your Node.js version is also compatible. If you encounter difficulty, carefully create a minimal example to show the conflict, and provide context of the error messages encountered.
