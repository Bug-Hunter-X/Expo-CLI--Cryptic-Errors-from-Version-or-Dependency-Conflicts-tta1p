# Expo CLI: Cryptic Errors from Version or Dependency Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive issue within the Expo CLI.  The problem is characterized by cryptic error messages during development, often stemming from mismatched versions or dependency conflicts.  The error message provides little information for debugging. 

The `expoBug.js` file shows an example project exhibiting this behavior (intentionally causing a conflict) and the `expoBugSolution.js` offers the solution and best practice to prevent this type of error. 

## Reproducing the Bug

Follow these steps to reproduce the cryptic error:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Attempt to run `expo start`.  You should encounter a vague or unhelpful error message from the Expo CLI.

## Solution

The core issue is usually caused by the mismatch of versions of expo and expo packages. The solution in `expoBugSolution.js` shows how to use `npx expo install expo` and how to make sure all expo packages have the correct versions.  Always ensure your dependencies in `package.json` are aligned with each other and with the Expo CLI version.  Use `expo upgrade` frequently and clear your cache. Consider using a version manager (e.g., nvm) for Node.js to isolate project dependencies.

## Best Practices

*   **Keep your `package.json` dependencies up-to-date:** Use `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` regularly.
*   **Use `expo upgrade`:** This command helps to update your project to use the latest stable version of Expo.
*   **Clear the cache:** Sometimes a stale cache can lead to issues. Use `expo prebuild --clean` to wipe the build cache.
*   **Check the Expo CLI version:** Ensure you're using a compatible version of the Expo CLI with your project's dependencies.
*   **Consider a Node.js version manager (nvm):** To help manage project-specific Node versions.
*   **Reproduce the error carefully:**  Start by creating a minimal project that exhibits this problem to isolate the issue.
